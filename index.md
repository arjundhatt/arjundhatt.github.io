## About me 

My name is Arjun and I am a student at the University of Toronto studying statistics. Throughout my time at the University of Toronto, I have taken many interesting statistics courses related to topics such as probability, data analysis, sampling and much more. Statistics is a field that I find interesting due to it's relevance in many different subjects; in particular, I find it's application in insurance to be most interesting.

### Relevant courses 

During my third year studying statistics at the University of Toronto, I took many interesting courses that allowed me to further develop my statistics knowledge. Below, I will include a list of statistics courses I took and the concepts that I learned while taking them:

##### STA302- Methods of Data Analysis 

Learned about data analysis with a large emphasis on linear regression. Learned how to make inferences from the parameters of a linear regression — using lm() function in R — and how to interpret confidence and prediction intervals. 

##### STA304- Surveys, Sampling & Observational Data

Learned how to effectively design surveys and interpret results from large surveys. Also learned how to make inferences from sampled data and how to deal with bias and missing data. 

##### STA314- Statistical Methods for Machine Learning 

Learned about how degrees of freedom can affect the interprability of our results and it's relation with test error, training error, and cross validation. Also learned about various methods for both supervised and unsupervised data such as k-means clustering, nearest neighbours, principal components analysis and many more.

##### STA347- Probability 

Took a more theoretical approach to the topic of probability by taking an in-depth look on topics such as random variables, independence, expectation and variance. Also learned about various types of convergence and stochastic processes.
