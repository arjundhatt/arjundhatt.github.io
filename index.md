## About me 

My name is Arjun and I am a student at the University of Toronto studying statistics. Throughout my time at the University of Toronto, I have taken many interesting statistics courses related to topics such as probability, data analysis, sampling and much more. Statistics is a field that I find interesting due to it's relevance in many different subjects; in particular, I find it's application in insurance to be most interesting.
