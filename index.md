## About me 

My name is Arjun and I am a student at the University of Toronto studying statistics. Throughout my time at the University of Toronto, I have taken many interesting statistics courses related to topics such as probability, data analysis, sampling and much more. Statistics is a field that I find interesting due to it's relevance in many different subjects; in particular, I find it's application in insurance to be most interesting.

## Relevant courses 

During my third year studying statistics at the University of Toronto, I took many interesting courses that allowed me to further develop my statistics knowledge. Below, I will include a list of statistics courses I took and the concepts that I learned while taking them:

##### STA302- Methods of Data Analysis 

Learned about data analysis with a large emphasis on linear regression. Learned how to make inferences from the parameters of a linear regression — using lm() function in R — and how to interpret confidence and prediction intervals. 

##### STA304- Surveys, Sampling & Observational Data

Learned how to effectively design surveys and interpret results from large surveys. Also learned how to make inferences from sampled data and how to deal with bias and missing data. 

##### STA314- Statistical Methods for Machine Learning 

Learned about how degrees of freedom can affect the interprability of our results and it's relation with test error, training error, and cross validation. Also learned about various methods for both supervised and unsupervised data such as k-means clustering, nearest neighbours, principal components analysis and many more.

##### STA347- Probability 

Took a more theoretical approach to the topic of probability by taking an in-depth look on topics such as random variables, independence, expectation and variance. Also learned about various types of convergence and stochastic processes.  

## CV 

Below I will include a digital CV: 

#### Actuarial Exams 

Exam FM- Passed August 2018

Exam P- Passed July 2019 

#### Education 

University of Toronto 

Bachelor of Science- Statistics Specialist & Cinema Studies Minor

#### Work Experience 

University of Toronto Statistical Sciences Peer Mentor

• Met with a group of approximately 10 first year students to help them get involved in the school community and within the Statistical Sciences community to help students easily transition to university life

• Provided support to first year students by helping them navigate activities and events on campus, and also promoted activities and events that would help the students learn and succeed at the university

#### Extracurricular Experience 

University of Toronto Statistical Science Union Events Director

• Responsible for planning and executing social and career related events for undergraduate students in the Statistics and Actuarial Science programs to provide knowledge and a sense of community for students

• Conduct surveys after events to get an understanding of what aspects of the events can be improved on and also to find what students are most interested in order to provide meaningful updates



## R resources I find useful 

Below, I will include some R resources I found useful when learning R for the first time: 

#### general

When learning R for the first time, learning how to create variables, vectors, loops, etc. is very useful. The following cheatsheet is very helpful with getting familiar with how to perform those actions: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf

#### ggplot2 

ggplot2 is a package that assists in visualizing data and I use it almost everytime I open R, so I always found this cheatsheet very helpful: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf

#### dplyr

dplyr is a package that assists in wrangling data, so I find the following cheatsheet to be very helpful: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf
